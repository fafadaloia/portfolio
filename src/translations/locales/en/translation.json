      "I am a computer technician and freelance developer with three years of experience. Throughout my career I have built a wide range of projects, from a 100% transparent and anonymous electronic voting system to fully automated platforms powered by artificial intelligence.",
      "One of my most notable projects is Zeta AI, a tool designed to help companies and entrepreneurs automate processes: AI-generated images and videos, inventory management, multichannel publishing across e-commerce and social media, and multilingual customer support.",
      "My primary tools are JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Python, HTML, and CSS. I also have experience with Java, C, C#, C++, Basic, Pascal, SQL, and some PHP.",
      "My approach is centered on listening and understanding each client's identity. I aim to create solutions that reflect their values and remain functional, intuitive, and visually clean. I believe in working side by side, improving continuously, and always contributing my highest technical and human standards.",
      "In the short term, my goal is for Zeta AI to grow into a globally recognized tool. Long term, I aspire to build a proprietary artificial intelligence within NeKa Labs, continuing the path of innovation and shaping the future."
